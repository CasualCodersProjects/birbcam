## Tech Stack

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [Python Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire)
- Whatever else you think could help

## Details

- Will be open source under the MIT license on the Casual Coders GitHub.
- Will run on a mid tier gaming laptop from 2016. 1060 6GB. 16GB VRAM. Manjaro Linux.
- I was thinking to use [Haar Cascades](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html), but if you can find a better solution Iâ€™m open to it.
- The feed will be piped in from a webcam, but for testing you can use a video or images.
